## Purpose


A project management tool and social media collaboration space for movie directors, assistants, and crew members.

They are also able to friend other directors, cast talent and crew, as well as set a budget for their projects. Additionally, they are able to write blog posts about their movies and projects throughout the process. 


Cinemake is a project management tool for movie directors to plan, budget, and organize their projects, connect with other directors, and blog about their process. I used this project to help me learn to create a Ruby on Rails App. 

Currently the app looks like this:

Ideally this will look much more dynamic with an additional possibility of learning websockets in order to create more functionality enabling directors connect and chat with other directors. Additionally, I hope to make the director profiles
